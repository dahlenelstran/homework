\section*{Introduction}

Let us begin by noting that every complex number $z$ can be written as $z=x+iy$, where $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$.

\begin{definition}
  A function is \textbf{holomorphic} at the point $z \in \mathbb{C}$ if the limit 
  \begin{equation*}
    \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(z+h)-f(z)}{h}, \text{ where } h \in \mathbb{C}
  \end{equation*}
  exists.
\end{definition}

\begin{aq}
  So is this just being differentiable for complex numbers?
\end{aq}
\begin{answer}
  Essentially, however because complex numbers have a value (radius) and an angle, $h$ can approach 0 from 
  infinitely many angles. So holomorphicity is much stronger than differentiablity; In the real case, it 
  is differentiable going left and right. For a function to be holomorphic at a point, it must be differentiable 
  from infinitely many angles.
\end{answer}

\begin{fact}
  If $f$ is holomorphic in $\Omega$, then for appropriate closed paths in $\Omega$, 
  \begin{equation*}
    \int_{\gamma} f(z)dz=0.
  \end{equation*}
\end{fact}

\begin{fact}
  If $f$ is holomorphic, then $f$ is indefinitely differentiable.
\end{fact}

\begin{uq}
  Why indefinitely differentiable? Why not indefinitely holomorphic?
\end{uq}

\begin{fact}
  If $f$ and $g$ are holomorphic functions in $\Omega$ which are equal in an arbitrarily samll disc in 
  $\omega$, then $f=g$ everywhere in $\Omega$.
\end{fact}

\begin{definition}
  The \textbf{zeta function},
  \begin{equation*}
    \zeta (s)=\sum^{\infty}_{n=1} \frac{1}{n^s}
  \end{equation*}
  is holomorphic in the half-plane Re($s$) $> 1$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  The \textbf{theta function} is the following:
  \begin{equation*}
    \Theta (z \vert \tau) = \sum^{\infty}_{n=-\infty} e^{\pi i n^2 \tau}e^{2\pi i n z}
  \end{equation*}
\end{definition}

\section{Preliminaries to Complex Analysis}

\subsection{Complex Numbers and the Complex Plane}

We can imagine complex numbers as an ordered pair of the two real numbers:
  
\par \begin{center} \includegraphics[scale=.2]{1-1.png} \end{center}

Addition and mulitplication are defined like so:

\begin{align*}
  z_1+z_2 &= (x_1+x_2)+i(y_1+y_2) \\
  z_1 * z_2 &= (x_1x_2 - y_1y_2) + i (x_1y_2+y_1x_2)
\end{align*}

It is easy to prove that commutativity, associativity, and distributivity hold for complex numbers. 
We can think about addition like adding two vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and mulitplication like 
a rotation and dilation.

\begin{definition}
  The length, or absolute value of a complex number, is defined as the following:
  \begin{equation*}
    \vert z \vert = (x^2 + y^2)^{1/2}
  \end{equation*}
\end{definition}

Note that this is the same as taking the norm, or length, of a vector in $\mathbb{R}^2$, or even 
finding the length of the hypotenuse that is created by the $x$ and $y$ values.

\par The triangle equality holds: 

\begin{theorem}{Triangle Inequality}
  \begin{equation*}
    \vert z + w \vert \leq \vert z \vert + \vert w \vert
  \end{equation*}
  for all $z,x \in \mathbb{C}$.
\end{theorem}

From the triangle inequality, there comes this helpful fact as well:

\begin{fact}
  \begin{equation*}
    \vert \vert z \vert - \vert w \vert \vert \leq \vert z - w \vert 
  \end{equation*}
\end{fact}

You can imagine a complex conjugate, $\bar{z} = x - iy$, as a reflection across the real (horizontal) axis.

\par The following are also useful facts easily deduced:

\begin{fact}
  \begin{equation*}
    \text{Re} (z) = \frac{z+\bar{z}}{2} \text{ and } \text{Im} (z) = \frac{z-\bar{z}}{2i}
  \end{equation*}
\end{fact}

\begin{fact}
  \begin{equation*}
  \vert z \vert = z \bar{z} \text{ and, when } z \neq 0 \text{, } \frac{1}{z} = {\bar{z}}{\vert z \vert ^2}
  \end{equation*}
\end{fact}

\begin{definition}
  A complex number $z$'s \textbf{polar form} is written as $z=re^{i \theta}$, where $r > 0$, and 
  $\theta$ is referred to as the \textbf{argument} of $z$.
\end{definition}

A mathematical fact useful in Complex Analysis is $e^{i \theta} = \cos{\theta} + i \sin{\theta}$.

From the two previous statements, we can see that $r=\vert z \vert$, the length of $z$, and $\theta$ is the angle. 

\par \begin{center} \includegraphics[scale=.2]{1-2.png} \end{center}

With this form, we can redefine mulitplication to be:

\begin{equation*}
  z = re^{i \theta}, w=se^{i \phi} \implies zw=rse^{i(\theta + \phi)}\
\end{equation*}

It is easier to see in this definition that mulitplication is simply a rotation ($\theta + \phi$), and 
a dilation ($rs$).

\begin{definition}
  A sequence $\{z_1, z_2, \dots \}$ of complex numbers is said to \textbf{converge} 
  to $w \in \mathbb{C}$ if 
  $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \vert z_n - w \vert = 0 \text{ or,equivalently, } w = \lim_{n \to \infty} z_n. $$
\end{definition}

\begin{aq}
  Is this just the same thing as being convergent in $\mathbb{R}$? Just that the limit is a complex 
  number, not a real one?
\end{aq}

\begin{answer}
  Stein states that $z_n$ converges to $w$ if and only if the sequence of the real and imaginary parts
  of $z_n$ converge to the real and imaginary parts of $w$. This makes sense, as in real convergence, 
  it converges to a $y$ value, but in the complex plane, it must converge from the $x$ (real) direction, 
  and the $y$ (imaginary) direction.
\end{answer}

\begin{uq}
  Given the previous answer, is it possible for a complex sequence to converge in the real direction 
  much sooner than the imaginary? Does the difference in "convergence speed" matter?
\end{uq}

\begin{definition}
  A sequence $\{ z_n \}$ is said to be a \textbf{Cauchy Sequence} if 
  $$ \vert z_n - z_m \vert \to 0 \text{ as } n,m \to \infty .$$
\end{definition}

Similarly to Real Analysis, a sequence is Cauchy if it's elements get closer and closer together 
as the sequence reaches infinity. 

\begin{aq}
  How can a sequence be convergent, but not Cauchy?
\end{aq}
\begin{answer}
  Being convergent always implies the sequence is Cauchy, because if the elements get farther away from each 
  other, they can never approach a limit. But it is possible for a sequence to be Cauchy and not convergent. 
  This is because being Cauchy doesn't specify a value for the limit; it is possible the Cauchy sequence is 
  approaching a value outside whatever space we're discussing. Thus from our scope (only considering our space 
  missing the limit value), the sequence is not convergent.
\end{answer}

Similar to convergence, the sequence $\{z_n\}$ is Cauchy if and only if the real and imaginary parts are. 

\begin{definition}
  A space is \textbf{complete} if every Cauchy sequence converges to a point in the space. 
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}{}
  The complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$ is complete.
\end{theorem}
\begin{newproof}
  Because $\mathbb{R}$ is complete, we know every real Cauchy sequence has a limit in $\mathbb{R}$. Thus 
  the real and imaginary parts of any Cauchy sequence must converge, so $\{z_n\}$ must converge as well. 
\end{newproof}

\begin{definition}
  If $z_0 \in \mathbb{C}$ and $r > 0$, we define the \textbf{open disc $D_r(z_0)$ of radius $r$ centered 
  at $z_0$} to be the set of all complex numbers that are at absolute value strictly less than 
  $r$ from $z_0$. Alternatively,
  $$ D_r(z_0)=\{z \in \mathbb{C} : \vert z - z_0 \vert < r \} $$
\end{definition}

An open disc is just a circle of radius $r$, centered at $x_0$, with no "edge". It's called the "open circle" 
because it is an open set. 

\begin{definition}
  Similarly, a \textbf{closed disc} is defined as 
  $$ \bar{D}_r(z_0)=\{z \in \mathbb{C} : \vert z - z_0 \vert \leq r \} $$
\end{definition}

This is just a disc including the boundary, so it is a closed set. 

\begin{definition}
  As you can imagine, the \textbf{boundary of a disc} is defined as so:
  $$ C_r(z_0)=\{z \in \mathbb{C} : \vert z - z_0 \vert = r \} $$
\end{definition}

\begin{notation}
  The \textbf{unit disc} is defined as the following:
  $$ \mathbb{D} = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : \vert z \vert < 1 \} $$
\end{notation}

This is just an open disc centered at the origin of radius one. 

\begin{definition}
  Given a set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}$, a point $z_0$ is an \textbf{interior point} of $\Omega$ if there 
  exists $r > 0$ such that $D_r(z_0) \subset \Omega$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  The \textbf{interior} of a set consists of all it's interior points.
\end{definition}

\begin{aq}
  So is the interior just everything other than the boundary and exterior? Meaning an open disc is equivalent to
  it's interior?
\end{aq}
\begin{answer}
  Yes. :)
\end{answer}

\begin{definition}
  A set if \textbf{open} if every point in that set is an interior point. Similarly, a set is \textbf{closed} 
  if it's complement $\Omega^c = \mathbb{C} - \Omega$ is open.
\end{definition}

Note that $\Omega^c = \mathbb{C} - \Omega$ is just the exterior of the set. So if the exterior is open, then 
$\Omega$ must include it's boundary.

\begin{definition}
  A point $z \in \mathbb{C}$ is said to be a \textbf{limit point} of the set $\Omega$ if there exists a sequence 
  of points $z_n \in \Omega$ such that $z_n \neq z$ and $\lim_{n \to \infty} z_n = z$. 
\end{definition}

So an example of a limit point would be a point in the boundary. It is worth noting that a set is closed 
if and only if it contains all it's limit points (boundary points).

\begin{definition}
  The \textbf{closure} of any set $\Omega$ is the union of $\Omega$ and its limit points, and is often denoted 
  by $\bar{\Omega}$. 
\end{definition}

So in an open set, the closure would be the set and it's boundary (what could be added to the set 
to make it closed). In a closed set, the closure is just the set itself. 

\begin{definition} 
  The \textbf{boundary} of a set $\Omega$ is equal to its closure minus its interior, and is often 
  denotes by $\delta \Omega$.
\end{definition}

So the boundary is just the set of limit points. 

\begin{definition}
  A set $\Omega$ is \textbf{bounded} if there exists $M > 0$ such that $\vert z \vert < M$ whenever $z \in
  \Omega$. 
\end{definition}

So it is the same as being bounded in Real Analysis, just instead of a horizontal line at height $M$, 
it is a disc with radius $M$ centered at the origin. 

\begin{definition}
  If $\Omega$ is bounded, we define its \textbf{diameter} by 
  $$ \text{diam}(\Omega) = \sup_{z,w \in \Omega} \vert z - w \vert $$
\end{definition}

So the diameter is just the furthest straight line you can draw between any two points. 

\begin{definition}
  A set $\Omega$ is said to be \textbf{compact} if it is closed and bounded.
\end{definition}

Note that this is the same definition as Real Analysis.

\begin{theorem}{}
  The set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}$ is compact if and only if every sequence $\{ z_n \} \subset \Omega$ 
  has a subsequence that converges to a point in $\Omega$.
\end{theorem}

This is just saying that every sequence in the set can be "cut off" at a point and still converge
in the set.

\begin{newproof}
  This follows from the similar statement in Real Analysis, and the correspondence between convergence in
  the real and complex plane.
\end{newproof}

\begin{definition}
  An \textbf{open covering} of $\Omega$ is a family of open sets $\{ U_{\alpha}\}$ such that 
    $\Omega \subset \bigcup_{\alpha} U_{\alpha}$.
\end{definition}

An open covering is just any set of open discs that completely cover the set on the complex plane. Here's 
how I visualize it:

\par \begin{center} \includegraphics[scale=.2]{1-3.png} \end{center}

where both the red and blue parts are different subcovers. Note that a subcover can have 
uncountably many open sets.

\begin{theorem}{}
  A set $\Omega$ is compact if and only if every open covering has a finite subcovering.
\end{theorem}

This is similar to the statement in Real Analysis, and can be proved using that. But the general idea 
is that if a set is compact, it's not infinite in size (more accurately, diameter), and it's closed. If
this is the case, then clearly you can have a finite subcovering of any open cover. 

\begin{uq}
  May want to look back at a proof of this. I'm not understanding why an open cover of infinitely many balls 
  around points would have a finite subcover, if the set itself is infinite.
\end{uq}

\begin{theorem}{}
  If $\Omega_1 \subset \Omega_2 \subset \dots \subset \Omega_n \subset \cdots$ is a sequence of 
  non-empty compact sets in $\mathbb{C}$ with the property that $\text{diam}(\Omega_n) \to 0$ 
  as $n \to \infty$, then there exists a unique point $w \in \mathbb{C}$ such that $w \in \Omega_n$ 
  for all $n$.
\end{theorem}

Visually, this is saying if you have a bunch of circles containing each other that get smaller and smaller, 
there must be some point in the center, where the smallest circles are, and there must only be one. 

\begin{newproof}
  Let $z_n$ be a point in each $\Omega_n$. Because $\text{diam}(\Omega_n) \to 0$, then 
  $\sup_{z,w \in \Omega_n} \vert z - w \vert \to 0$, by the definition of a diameter. Thus $\{ z_n \}$ is 
  a Cauchy sequence, because the points are getting closer and closer together. Thus it must converge, and 
  call this value $w$. Because each set is compact, we must have $w$ (a limit point), be in each set. If there 
  were another point satisfying this, call it $w'$, then the diameter between them would be nonzero, which is 
  a contradiction.
\end{newproof}

\begin{definition}
  An open set $\Omega \subset \C$ is said to be \textbf{connected} if it is not possible to find two disjoint 
  non-empty open sets $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ such that $\Omega = \Omega_1 \cap \Omega_2$. 
  Similarly, a closed set $F$ is connected if one cannot write $F = F_1 \cup F_2$ where $F_1$ and 
  $F_2$ are disjoint non-empty closed sets.
\end{definition}

If a set cannot be broken up into two disjoint open sets, there must be some "overlap". Connectedness 
is a  simple as it sounds.

{\Huge THIS IS WHERE I LEFT OFF}

\section{Meromorphic Functions and the Logarithm}

\subsection{Zeros and Poles}

\begin{definition}
  A \textbf{point singularity} of a function $f$ is a complex number $z_0$ such that $f$ is defined in a 
  neighborhood of $z_0$ but not at the point $z_0$ itself. This is also called an \textbf{isolated singularity}.
\end{definition}

An exmple of this could be the function $f$ that is defined on the punctured plane by $f(z)=z$. Then the 
origin is a point of singularity, unless we explicitly define $f(0)=0$. 

\begin{uq}
  So I'm confused-- why can't $f(0)=0$ naturally? What happens at $z=0$?
\end{uq}

Because the "issue" can be solved by explicitly defining the one point, we can call that singularity \textbf{removable}.

\par Another example is $f(z)=\frac{1}{z}$. This singularity (also at $z=0$) is called a \textbf{pole singularity}
because the function approaches infinity from the left and the right of the singularity.

\par A more complicated example is $f(z)=e^{i/z}$, which can not be explained by poles or removable singularities because 
the limits from the left and right on the real axis are not equal.

\begin{definition}
  A complex number $z_0$ is a \textbf{zero} for the holomorphic function $f$ if $f(z_0)=0$.
\end{definition}

Riveting, who could have guessed.

Note that if $f$ is holomorphic in $\Omega$ and $f(z_0)=0$ for some $z_0 \in \Omega$, then there exists an 
open neighborhood $U$ of $z_0$ such tht $f(z) \neq 0$ for all $z \in U - \{ z_0\}$, unless $f$ 
is identically zero.

\begin{theorem}{}
  Suppose that $f$ is holomorphic in a connected open set $\Omega$, has a zero at a point $z_0 \in \Omega$, and does not 
  vanish identically in $\Omega$. Then there exists a neighborhood $U \subset \Omega$ of $z_0$, a 
  nonvanishing holomorphic function $g$ on $U$, and a unique positive integer $n$ such that
  $$ f(z) = (z-z_0)^ng(z) \text{ for all } z \in U. $$
\end{theorem}

So all this is saying is that if there is a zero in a nonzero holomorphic function, the function in a neighborhood 
of this point can be written in the above form.

\begin{newproof}
  Bruh go back and fill this out!!!!
\end{newproof}
