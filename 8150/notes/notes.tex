\section*{Introduction}

Let us begin by noting that every complex number $z$ can be written as $z=x+iy$, where $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$.

\begin{definition}
  A function is \textbf{holomorphic} at the point $z \in \mathbb{C}$ if the limit 
  \begin{equation*}
    \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(z+h)-f(z)}{h}, \text{ where } h \in \mathbb{C}
  \end{equation*}
  exists.
\end{definition}

\begin{aq}
  So is this just being differentiable for complex numbers?
\end{aq}
\begin{answer}
  Essentially, however because complex numbers have a value (radius) and an angle, $h$ can approach 0 from 
  infinitely many angles. So holomorphicity is much stronger than differentiablity; In the real case, it 
  is differentiable going left and right. For a function to be holomorphic at a point, it must be differentiable 
  from infinitely many angles.
\end{answer}

\begin{fact}
  If $f$ is holomorphic in $\Omega$, then for appropriate closed paths in $\Omega$, 
  \begin{equation*}
    \int_{\gamma} f(z)dz=0.
  \end{equation*}
\end{fact}

\begin{fact}
  If $f$ is holomorphic, then $f$ is indefinitely differentiable.
\end{fact}

\begin{uq}
  Why indefinitely differentiable? Why not indefinitely holomorphic?
\end{uq}

\begin{fact}
  If $f$ and $g$ are holomorphic functions in $\Omega$ which are equal in an arbitrarily samll disc in 
  $\omega$, then $f=g$ everywhere in $\Omega$.
\end{fact}

\begin{definition}
  The \textbf{zeta function},
  \begin{equation*}
    \zeta (s)=\sum^{\infty}_{n=1} \frac{1}{n^s}
  \end{equation*}
  is holomorphic in the half-plane Re($s$) $> 1$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  The \textbf{theta function} is the following:
  \begin{equation*}
    \Theta (z \vert \tau) = \sum^{\infty}_{n=-\infty} e^{\pi i n^2 \tau}e^{2\pi i n z}
  \end{equation*}
\end{definition}

\section{Preliminaries to Complex Analysis}

\subsection{Complex Numbers and the Complex Plane}

We can imagine complex numbers as an ordered pair of the two real numbers:
  
\par \begin{center} \includegraphics[scale=.2]{1-1.png} \end{center}

Addition and mulitplication are defined like so:

\begin{align*}
  z_1+z_2 &= (x_1+x_2)+i(y_1+y_2) \\
  z_1 * z_2 &= (x_1x_2 - y_1y_2) + i (x_1y_2+y_1x_2)
\end{align*}

It is easy to prove that commutativity, associativity, and distributivity hold for complex numbers. 
We can think about addition like adding two vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and mulitplication like 
a rotation and dilation.

\begin{definition}
  The length, or absolute value of a complex number, is defined as the following:
  \begin{equation*}
    \vert z \vert = (x^2 + y^2)^{1/2}
  \end{equation*}
\end{definition}

Note that this is the same as taking the norm, or length, of a vector in $\mathbb{R}^2$, or even 
finding the length of the hypotenuse that is created by the $x$ and $y$ values.

\par The triangle equality holds: 

\begin{theorem}{Triangle Inequality}
  \begin{equation*}
    \vert z + w \vert \leq \vert z \vert + \vert w \vert
  \end{equation*}
  for all $z,x \in \mathbb{C}$.
\end{theorem}

From the triangle inequality, there comes this helpful fact as well:

\begin{fact}
  \begin{equation*}
    \vert \vert z \vert - \vert w \vert \vert \leq \vert z - w \vert 
  \end{equation*}
\end{fact}

You can imagine a complex conjugate, $\bar{z} = x - iy$, as a reflection across the real (horizontal) axis.

\par The following are also useful facts easily deduced:

\begin{fact}
  \begin{equation*}
    \text{Re} (z) = \frac{z+\bar{z}}{2} \text{ and } \text{Im} (z) = \frac{z-\bar{z}}{2i}
  \end{equation*}
\end{fact}

\begin{fact}
  \begin{equation*}
  \vert z \vert = z \bar{z} \text{ and, when } z \neq 0 \text{, } \frac{1}{z} = {\bar{z}}{\vert z \vert ^2}
  \end{equation*}
\end{fact}

\begin{definition}
  A complex number $z$'s \textbf{polar form} is written as $z=re^{i \theta}$, where $r > 0$, and 
  $\theta$ is referred to as the \textbf{argument} of $z$.
\end{definition}

A mathematical fact useful in Complex Analysis is $e^{i \theta} = \cos{\theta} + i \sin{\theta}$.

From the two previous statements, we can see that $r=\vert z \vert$, the length of $z$, and $\theta$ is the angle. 

\par \begin{center} \includegraphics[scale=.2]{1-2.png} \end{center}

With this form, we can redefine mulitplication to be:

\begin{equation*}
  z = re^{i \theta}, w=se^{i \phi} \implies zw=rse^{i(\theta + \phi)}\
\end{equation*}

It is easier to see in this definition that mulitplication is simply a rotation ($\theta + \phi$), and 
a dilation ($rs$).

\begin{definition}
  A sequence $\{z_1, z_2, \dots \}$ of complex numbers is said to \textbf{converge} 
  to $w \in \mathbb{C}$ if 
  $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \vert z_n - w \vert = 0 \text{ or,equivalently, } w = \lim_{n \to \infty} z_n. $$
\end{definition}

\begin{aq}
  Is this just the same thing as being convergent in $\mathbb{R}$? Just that the limit is a complex 
  number, not a real one?
\end{aq}

\begin{answer}
  Stein states that $z_n$ converges to $w$ if and only if the sequence of the real and imaginary parts
  of $z_n$ converge to the real and imaginary parts of $w$. This makes sense, as in real convergence, 
  it converges to a $y$ value, but in the complex plane, it must converge from the $x$ (real) direction, 
  and the $y$ (imaginary) direction.
\end{answer}

\begin{uq}
  Given the previous answer, is it possible for a complex sequence to converge in the real direction 
  much sooner than the imaginary? Does the difference in "convergence speed" matter?
\end{uq}

\begin{definition}
  A sequence $\{ z_n \}$ is said to be a \textbf{Cauchy Sequence} if 
  $$ \vert z_n - z_m \vert \to 0 \text{ as } n,m \to \infty .$$
\end{definition}

Similarly to Real Analysis, a sequence is Cauchy if it's elements get closer and closer together 
as the sequence reaches infinity. 

\begin{aq}
  How can a sequence be convergent, but not Cauchy?
\end{aq}
\begin{answer}
  Being convergent always implies the sequence is Cauchy, because if the elements get farther away from each 
  other, they can never approach a limit. But it is possible for a sequence to be Cauchy and not convergent. 
  This is because being Cauchy doesn't specify a value for the limit; it is possible the Cauchy sequence is 
  approaching a value outside whatever space we're discussing. Thus from our scope (only considering our space 
  missing the limit value), the sequence is not convergent.
\end{answer}

Similar to convergence, the sequence $\{z_n\}$ is Cauchy if and only if the real and imaginary parts are. 

\begin{definition}
  A space is \textbf{complete} if every Cauchy sequence converges to a point in the space. 
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}{}
  The complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$ is complete.
\end{theorem}
\begin{newproof}
  Because $\mathbb{R}$ is complete, we know every real Cauchy sequence has a limit in $\mathbb{R}$. Thus 
  the real and imaginary parts of any Cauchy sequence must converge, so $\{z_n\}$ must converge as well. 
\end{newproof}

\begin{definition}
  If $z_0 \in \mathbb{C}$ and $r > 0$, we define the \textbf{open disc $D_r(z_0)$ of radius $r$ centered 
  at $z_0$} to be the set of all complex numbers that are at absolute value strictly less than 
  $r$ from $z_0$. Alternatively,
  $$ D_r(z_0)=\{z \in \mathbb{C} : \vert z - z_0 \vert < r \} $$
\end{definition}

An open disc is just a circle of radius $r$, centered at $x_0$, with no "edge". It's called the "open circle" 
because it is an open set. 

\begin{definition}
  Similarly, a \textbf{closed disc} is defined as 
  $$ \bar{D}_r(z_0)=\{z \in \mathbb{C} : \vert z - z_0 \vert \leq r \} $$
\end{definition}

This is just a disc including the boundary, so it is a closed set. 

\begin{definition}
  As you can imagine, the \textbf{boundary of a disc} is defined as so:
  $$ C_r(z_0)=\{z \in \mathbb{C} : \vert z - z_0 \vert = r \} $$
\end{definition}

\begin{notation}
  The \textbf{unit disc} is defined as the following:
  $$ \mathbb{D} = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : \vert z \vert < 1 \} $$
\end{notation}

This is just an open disc centered at the origin of radius one. 

\begin{definition}
  Given a set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}$, a point $z_0$ is an \textbf{interior point} of $\Omega$ if there 
  exists $r > 0$ such that $D_r(z_0) \subset \Omega$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  The \textbf{interior} of a set consists of all it's interior points.
\end{definition}

\begin{aq}
  So is the interior just everything other than the boundary and exterior? Meaning an open disc is equivalent to
  it's interior?
\end{aq}
\begin{answer}
  Yes. :)
\end{answer}

\begin{definition}
  A set if \textbf{open} if every point in that set is an interior point. Similarly, a set is \textbf{closed} 
  if it's complement $\Omega^c = \mathbb{C} - \Omega$ is open.
\end{definition}

Note that $\Omega^c = \mathbb{C} - \Omega$ is just the exterior of the set. So if the exterior is open, then 
$\Omega$ must include it's boundary.

\begin{definition}
  A point $z \in \mathbb{C}$ is said to be a \textbf{limit point} of the set $\Omega$ if there exists a sequence 
  of points $z_n \in \Omega$ such that $z_n \neq z$ and $\lim_{n \to \infty} z_n = z$. 
\end{definition}
